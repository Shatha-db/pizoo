# 🔧 Gradle Wrapper Fix for GitHub Actions

## ❌ Problem
GitHub Actions is failing with the error:
```
Error: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file exists locally but is **not tracked in the Git repository**. GitHub Actions cannot find this essential file when building the Android APK.

## ✅ Current Status of Wrapper Files

### Files That EXIST Locally:
- ✅ `frontend/android/gradlew` (8,762 bytes) - **Tracked by Git**
- ✅ `frontend/android/gradlew.bat` (2,966 bytes) - **Tracked by Git**  
- ✅ `frontend/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` (253 bytes) - **Tracked by Git**
- ❌ `frontend/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` (43,583 bytes) - **NOT tracked by Git**

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` is the missing piece!

## 🛠️ Solution (Choose ONE Method)

### Method 1: Add the Existing JAR File (Recommended - Fastest)

Since the `gradle-wrapper.jar` already exists locally, you just need to add it to Git:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Add the gradle wrapper JAR file
git add frontend/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

# Commit the change
git commit -m "Add missing gradle-wrapper.jar for GitHub Actions"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Method 2: Regenerate ALL Wrapper Files (If Method 1 Doesn't Work)

If you prefer to regenerate everything from scratch:

```bash
# Navigate to the Android directory
cd frontend/android

# Regenerate the wrapper (requires Gradle to be installed)
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.11.1

# Add all wrapper files
git add gradlew gradlew.bat gradle/wrapper/

# Commit
git commit -m "Regenerate Gradle wrapper files"

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Using Emergent's "Save to GitHub" Feature

The easiest way (as per the platform guidelines):
1. Use the **"Save to GitHub"** button in the Emergent platform
2. This will automatically commit and push all untracked files including `gradle-wrapper.jar`

## ⚙️ Verification

After pushing the changes, GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. ✅ Checkout the code (including `gradle-wrapper.jar`)
2. ✅ Set up Java 17
3. ✅ Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` successfully
4. ✅ Generate the APK
5. ✅ Upload the APK as an artifact

## 📋 What's in the Gradle Wrapper?

The Gradle wrapper consists of:
- `gradlew` - Unix/Linux executable script
- `gradlew.bat` - Windows executable script  
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` - **The actual Java code that downloads and runs Gradle**
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` - Configuration (Gradle version, download URL)

The JAR file is essential - without it, the gradlew script has nothing to execute!

## 🎯 Expected Result

After fixing this, your GitHub Actions workflow will succeed and you'll see:
```
✅ Build Android APK
✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
✅ APK uploaded as artifact
```

You'll be able to download the APK from:
- GitHub Actions → Workflows → Build Android APK → Artifacts → pizoo-debug-apk

**Note:** This is NOT a code bug - it's simply a missing file in the Git repository. The wrapper files work perfectly locally; they just need to be pushed to GitHub.
